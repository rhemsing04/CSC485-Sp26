Goals for this week:
- [ ] Do exploratory data analysis
- [ ] Figure out how to pull request in Git
- [ ] upload slides from MTH320 project

## Last Week's Goals:

- [x] Upload folder to Git
- [ ] Complete introduction
- [ ] Upload photo to Git

## Reflections:

I was able to complete the introduction form that Dr. Chou uploaded. 
I uploaded a photo to Git but it was under my personal branch and not the main branch. This week I hope to address this issue and make sure I can complete a pull request properly.
